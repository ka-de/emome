# Emome

## The Emoji picker application that shouldn't exist

![Product Demo](https://github.com/ka-de/emome/raw/main/repo-padding/product-demo.webp)

This module defines a GUI application that displays a grid of emojis and allows
the user to copy them to the clipboard by clicking on them. The emojis are
organized into seven sets, and the user can switch between them using keyboard
shortcuts. The application is built using PyQt5 and pyperclip libraries.
